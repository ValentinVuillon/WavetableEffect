# WavetableEffect
A tool to process a wavetable for Xfer Serum or Ableton Wavetable. I created it to be able to apply image processing algorithms to wavetables. For now it is able to do a convolution product between the wavetable and any kernel which lets you create blur, gaussian blur, edge detection.
